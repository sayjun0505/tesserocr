tesserocr
=========

A simple, |Pillow|_-friendly,
wrapper around the ``tesseract-ocr`` API for Optical Character Recognition
(OCR).

**tesserocr** integrates directly with Tesseract's C++ API using Cython
which allows for a simple Pythonic and easy-to-read source code. It
enables real concurrent execution when used with Python's ``threading``
module by releasing the GIL while processing an image in tesseract.

**tesserocr** is designed to be |Pillow|_-friendly but can also be used
with image files instead.

.. |Pillow| replace:: ``Pillow``
.. _Pillow: http://python-pillow.github.io/

Requirements
------------

Requires libtesseract (>=3.02) and libleptonica.

On Debian/Ubuntu:

::

    $ apt-get install tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev libleptonica-dev

Optionally requires ``Cython`` for building (otherwise the generated
.cpp file is compiled) and |Pillow|_ to support ``PIL.Image`` objects.

Installation
------------

::

    $ python setup.py install

Usage
-----

Initialize and re-use the tesseract API instance to score multiple
images:

.. code:: python

    from tesserocr import PyTessBaseAPI

    images = ['sample.jpg', 'sample2.jpg', 'sample3.jpg']

    with PyTessBaseAPI() as api:
        for img in images:
            api.SetImageFile(img)
            print api.GetUTF8Text()
            print api.AllWordConfidences()
    # api is automatically finalized when used in a with-statement (context manager).
    # otherwise api.End() should be explicitly called when it's no longer needed.

``PyTessBaseAPI`` exposes several tesseract API methods. Make sure you
read their docstrings for more info.

Basic example using available helper functions:

.. code:: python

    import tesserocr
    from PIL import Image

    print tesserocr.tesseract_version()  # print tesseract-ocr version
    print tesserocr.get_languages()  # prints tessdata path and list of available languages

    image = Image.open('sample.jpg')
    print tesserocr.image_to_text(image)  # print ocr text from image
    # or
    print tesserocr.file_to_text('sample.jpg')

``image_to_text`` and ``file_to_text`` can be used with ``threading`` to
concurrently process multiple images which is highly efficient.
